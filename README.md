# ModestHost
*ModestHost enables you to quickly host files on a local web server.*

## Operation
The default address of the local web server created by ModestHost is `localhost:8000`. If the default port is already used, ModestHost uses consecutive port numbers to set up the server. Once the server is up, its address automatically opens in a new tab of your default web browser.
